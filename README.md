## Abstract
A method for collecting data has been devised that uses a mobile and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
setup to get mobile data from people using an RGB camera and a pulse sensor.  
Through a deep learning method, the pulse rate is determined in a contactless manner 
using the self-generated dataset and two publicly available datasets. Using one publicly 
available dataset to train and test the PhysNet model yields state-of-the-art results. 
Cross-dataset training and testing the model resulted in poorer results, similar to classical 
machine learning methods. In summary, the presented method for rPPG is not yet suitable 
for reliable pulse rate determination in mobile patients.

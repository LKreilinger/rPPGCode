## Abstract
A method of data collection has been devised that uses a mobile and remote photoplethysmography (PPG) setup to obtain image data from people monitored with an
RGB camera and pulse sensor. Through deep learning, the pulse rate (PR) is determined in a contactless manner using a self-generated dataset and two publicly available
datasets. This study shows that the PhysNet model performs well on its training dataset,
which is the UBFC-rPPG dataset. However, validating deep learning models with crossdataset in this study indicates a weakness in the generalizability of the models. In
summary, the method proposed for remote-photoplethysmography (rPPG) is yet to be
suitable for the reliable determination of PR in versatile patients.
